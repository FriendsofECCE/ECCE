# The $ECCE_MESA_OPENGL variable is used to control whether the Mesa (software)
# OpenGL libraries installed under $ECCE_HOME/${ECCE_SYSDIR}3rdparty/mesa/lib
# should be used.  If available, hardware based OpenGL is preferred since
# performance is significantly better.  However, many workstations even with
# hardware graphics cards supporting OpenGL do not have the proper drivers
# installed and thus software rendering is used anyway.  For this reason
# the default is to use Mesa under 3rdparty/mesa/lib although sites/users are
# encouraged to either comment out this variable or set the value to false and
# install hardware OpenGL drivers if not already done.  The $ECCE_MESA_EXCEPT
# variable is used to list processors and platforms that should not use OpenGL
# libraries in the 3rdparty/mesa/lib directory even if $ECCE_MESA_OPENGL is set
# to true.  This lets sites configure some platforms to use the libraries
# in 3rdpary/mesa/lib and not for other platforms.  The 'uname -m' command is
# used to determine the processor and the 'lsb_release -is' command is used to
# determine the platform.  Substring searches are done using the colon
# separated values in $ECCE_MESA_EXCEPT against the full processor and platform
# name (e.g. RedHat in $ECCE_MESA_EXCEPT matches RedHatEnterpriseClient
# returned by 'lsb_release -is').  By default $ECCE_MESA_EXCEPT is commented
# out so 3rdparty/mesa/lib libraries are always used if they exist.

# For some platforms the OpenGL offscreen rendering capability needed to
# generate image files (JPEG, GIF, etc.) and thumbnail visualizations does
# not work and application crashes or X Window session crashes result.
# The only image file format not using offscreen rendering is POV-Ray so
# there is still a capability to generate graphics for publications and
# presentations without offscreen rendering.  Uncomment this line to turn
# off image file generation.

# this controls sending mail to the ecce-test queue for jobs recognized
# as job monitoring errors.  If the variable is not set no mail will ever
# be sent.  If it is set to "true" then mail for failed jobs will always
# be sent.  If it is set to some other value then that value is treated
# as a substring search pattern in the URL for any calculation that fails.
# Usually it will be the name of the data server or part of the IP domain
# name for the data server.  For example, "emsl.pnl.gov" results in mail
# being sent from all jobs run on EMSL data servers but no mail from data
# servers outside EMSL.  If you wish to enable this feature outside EMSL
# so that ECCE developers can work with you diagnosing problems with job
# monitoring, simply set the value to "true" rather than figuring out the
# proper data server domain name value.
