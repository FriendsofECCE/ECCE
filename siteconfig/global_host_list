# Place all machines in this file that are to be included in distributions
# other than for EMSL users.  Machines here are defined in the Machines file,
# Queues file (if applicable), and their CONFIG.<host> is included if it exists.
# 
# Only list machines that are globally accessible or are otherwise deemed to
# be important since example registrations are now provided in the 
# CONFIG-Examples directory.
