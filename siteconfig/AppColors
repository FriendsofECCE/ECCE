# Application Color Mapping
#
# Four possible themes can be specified or colors can be set individually.
# The four themes are:
#   Classic - Traditional ECCE colors prior to version 5.0
#   PNNL - Pacific Northwest National Laborary copper/silver branding
#   EMSL - Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory green branding
#   PNNL_EMSL - Combined copper and green branding
#
# Seven colors can be set individually by #RRGGBB hexadecimal value or by
# the name of color (no "#" character) for some basic colors.
# When a theme is also specified, setting an individual color overrides that
# one color in the theme, but the other theme colors are still used.
# The seven colors that can be set indvidually are:
#   Window - window background color
#   Menubar - application menubar background color
#   Text - color for all text including labels and input fields
#   Input - background color for enabled input fields
#   Readonly - background color for disabled fields
#   Caption - background color for dockable panel title bars (e.g. Builder)
#   CaptionGradient - lighter "fade to" color for panel title bars
#
# A "#" character before the name of a theme or color indicates the line
# is commented out and the setting is not applied.
# The following are the color values for the default PNNL color theme as a
# syntax example:
# Window: #e0e1e1
# Menubar: #b7b8ba
# Text: #000000
# Input: #f9dd99
# Readonly: #b7b8ba
# Caption: #d57500
# CaptionGradient: #e29e4c
#
# An application color mapping file may be specified at both the site level
# and for each user.  The site level file is named AppColors and resides in the
# $ECCE_HOME/siteconfig directory while user files are named MyAppColors
# and reside in ~/.ECCE4 preferences directories.  Settings for colors in user
# MyAppColors files override any in the site level AppColors file, though any
# colors not set in the user file will fallback to the site settings.  The
# Gateway Preferences dialog contains a choice box for selecting a theme as
# well.  Setting this preference to "Site Default" (default unless a user
# explicitly changes it) in the GUI will fallback to the site settings.
# Although the MyAppColors file is automatically generated, overriding the
# individual colors (Window, Input, etc.) can still be done by manually
# editing the file.

Theme: PNNL
