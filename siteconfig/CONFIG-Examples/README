This directory contains example CONFIG files for various types of
compute servers.  For queued machines customization is usually
required.  These examples are all from actual systems that have been or
are currently in use.

Note that real CONFIG files have names of the form CONFIG.<machinename>
so if the machine is named mcurie, the file shoul be named CONFIG.mcurie.

Note that some of the contents of the CONFIG.* files are written by the
machine registration gui.  Others must be provided by hand editing.
The GUI can be used again after making custom edits without loss of
information.

The general process of machine registration is documented in the Ecce web
pages (http://ecce.emsl.pnl.gov).  This pdf file is located at:
http://ecce.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/2864B-server_reg.pdf.  You should read this
document before proceeding and then use these examples as templates for
your systems.
