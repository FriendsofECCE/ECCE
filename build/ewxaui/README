This directory contains the scripts and Makefile needed to create the
ewxAUI library, which is an enhanced version of the standard wxWidgets wxAUI
library needed for the ECCE Builder/Viewer application.  This README as well
as the full ECCE build document describe how to create ewxAUI.  The scripts
are known to work for the wxPython/wxWidgets 2.8.x series of releases and will
likely require updates to be compatible with major new releases.

The steps for creating ewxAUI are:

1. cd $ECCE_HOME/build

2. cp -rf ewxaui <wxPython-src-directory>/bld

Note: <wxPython-src-directory> is the top-level directory where the wxPython
source code distribution was extracted and the wxWidgets/wxPython
builds are being done.

3. cd <wxPython-src-directory>/bld/ewxaui

4. ./auigen.sh

Note: Make sure this script completes successfully before proceeding.

5. make

Note: This step will both build and install ewxAUI.  The install directory
is derived from the Makefile in <wxPython-src-directory>/bld.
