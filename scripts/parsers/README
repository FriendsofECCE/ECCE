Overview
--------

This directory contains the following categories of files.

 - scripts for basis set file translation from the NWChem format that is 
   output by ECCE to formats of other codes.  These have names like
   "std2Gaussian-94".

 - scripts and templates for input file generation.  The templates have 
   names like "nwch.tpl" and "g94.tpl", and the input generation scripts 
   have names like "ai.gauss94".
  
 - parse descriptor files for each code.  These have names like 
   gaussian-94.desc.

 - property parse scripts for each descriptor in each .desc file,
   named according to the one or more of the properties that is 
   extracted, such as gaussian-94.eqcisd, which parses the text
   that contains the QCISD energy from gaussian-94.

 - wrapper scripts to invoke each registered code, such as ecce.nwchem.

 - the submit script, which is the top-level run script (and the IBM
   LoadLeveler file) that calls the wrapper script.

Products
--------
The files in this directory are used as is, i.e., no libraries or
binaries are generated.
