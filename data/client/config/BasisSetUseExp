# List of basis set names where explicit exponents and coefficients should
# always be used regardless of user setting.
#
# This is useful, for instance, when NWChem doesn't support the basis set for
# specific elements when it really should such as the correlation consistent
# basis sets with Calcium.
#
# Format is one basis set name per line.  Matching is done by substring so,
# for instance, CRENB will match both CRENBL and CRENBS basis sets. Quotes
# are used to match the beginning and ending of the name.  Comment lines
# start with # in the first column and blank lines are also ignored.
