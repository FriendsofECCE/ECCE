// POV-ray is a freely distributed ray-tracing program
// available at http://www.povray.org
//
// The POV-ray file is an ordinary text file that can be
// edited by the user to achieve effects that are not
// currently supported within Ecce. The most important of
// these is editing the illumination source to get off-
// center lighting. The illumination source is specified
// with the POV-ray "light_source" directive and can be
// modified by changing the first vector inclosed in the angle
// brackets following this directive.
//
// In most cases, the atom colors and the colors of the vectors
// are listed at the top of the file using the #declare statement,
// along with the surface finishes. These can also be edited by
// hand if necessary. Cases where this is not true are when
// creating a povray file from a display of partial charges or
// when using complex finishes, e.g. "Wood".
//
// The POV-ray images have a width:height aspect ratio of 4:3.
// On most systems the image can be scaled to the desired size
// when executing the povray command. To produce an image that
// is 800 by 600 pixels in size type
//   povray +W800 +H600 ./filename
// On most systems you can also type
//   povray -W800 -H600 ./filename
// The filename must have a .pov suffix. On some systems
// the pixels are not square and the ratio of width and height
// may need to be adjusted accordingly. See the POV-ray
// documentation for more information on this topic.
//
// We also recommend that you use the anti-aliasing option when
// processing the POV-ray input file. This consists of adding the
// option +A when processing the .pov file, e.g.
//   povray +W800 +H600 +A ./filename
// This option does increase the processing time, but in most cases
// will substantially improve the appearance of the final image.
