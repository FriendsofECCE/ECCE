# As of Ecce V1.5, the contents of this file have changed.
#
# This file contains system-wide override values for van der waals
# radius, covalent radius (single bonds/SP1), and a tolerance for
# bond generation.  Default values are compiled into the code.  This
# file is used only to provide a means for overriding these values.
# In particular, this is used to fix values without having to modify
# compiled code but without sacrificing performance by having to load
# all values dynamically.
#
# This same file format is used for user preferences following the 
# normal user preference scheme.
#
# There is currently no way to set vwr radii for different isotopes.
# This needs to be added when ecce supports charge assignment.
#
# Syntax:
# -------
# atomicsymbol:  vwr cr tolerance
# H: 1.1 0.36 1.2
#
# The radius values are in angstroms. The tolerance is a scale factor.
#
# Order of elements is not significant.  Case is sensitive.
