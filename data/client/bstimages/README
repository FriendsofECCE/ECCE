                     README for Basis Set Image directory

The following conventions are used for translating basis set files into
corresponding image file names.

1. All [().] are removed
2. Spaces and , are replaced with -
3. * is replaced with S
4. + is left as is
5. The file name is appended with .p# where # is period 1-7.

Both gif and xpm files are currently needed.  The gif files are used
by the Web-based basis set tool.  The xpm files are used by ECCE
software.  Only the gif files are revision controlled since the xpm
files can be generated from the gifs.  The script allxpmtogif converts
them all.
