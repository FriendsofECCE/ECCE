Note: an error was discovered in the carbon basis set published in J. Chem.
Phys. 101, (1994).  That error has been corrected in this version of the basis.
This collection of basis sets was designed to mimic and extend the correlation
consistent sets.  These sets were created before the official cc-pV6Z sets were
developed.

The oxygen basis was constructed of (s,p,d,f,g) exponents optimized by T. H.
Dunning along with h and i exponents extrapolated from other data by D. Feller.

The basic idea behind the correlation consistent basis sets is that functions
which contribute approximately the same amount of correlation energy should
be grouped together when considering what mixture of s,p,d,.. etc basis
functions to use.  For hydrogen the polarization exponents were determined by
optimizing them at the SD-CI level for molecular hydrogen in its ground
state.  The (s,p) exponents for B - Ne were optimized in atomic Hartree-
Fock calculations on the ground state.  The polarization exponents were
optimized at the SD-CI level.
