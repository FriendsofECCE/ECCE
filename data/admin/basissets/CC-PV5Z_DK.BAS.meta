The recontraction was performed by W.A. de Jong (to be published)

The contraction coefficients were generated by performing atomic ROHF
calculations using the atomic code ATSCF. The version used is an adaption by
Bernd Hess of a code by R. Pavani, G. C. Lie and E. Clementi (unpublished).
The Hamiltonian applied is the so-called Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian with
the speed of light = 137.0360 a.u. The contraction coefficients were generated
for the ground state of each atom. Atomic symmetry was imposed in the
generation of the contraction coefficients.
