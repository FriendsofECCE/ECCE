Li - Be: (10s,1p,1d) -> [3s,1p,1d]  (1992). Other basis sets were taken
 B - F : (10s,6p,1d) -> [3s,2p,1d]  from the DGauss Basis Set Library.
Al - Ar: (13s,9p,1d) -> [4s,3p,1d]
Sc - Zn: (15s,9p,5d) -> [5s,4p,2d]

These local spin density basis sets were developed by Nathalie Godbout and
Jan Andzelm.  They were taken from a file provided by Cray Research, Inc.
The file format was by M. Kohout and the basis sets were originally entered by
M. Kohout and Ilene Carpenter.
