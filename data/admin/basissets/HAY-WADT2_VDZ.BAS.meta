The Hay-Wadt (n+1) effective core potentials include an extra shell of
electrons beyond what is traditionally available in effective core potentials.
For example, on potassium the 3s and 3p electrons are not subsumed into the
core as they would be in other ECP's.  This set is derived from the exponents
and contraction coefficients given in the Hay-Wadt paper and were obtained
directly from P. J. Hay.  Any discrepancy between the numbers contained in
these basis sets and the JCP paper are attributable to the file obtained from
Jeff at Los Alamos.  The elements beyond Kr include the 1-electron Darwin and
mass-velocity relativistic corrections in their definitions.
