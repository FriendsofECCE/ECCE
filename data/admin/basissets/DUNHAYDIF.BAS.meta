These exponents were optimized at the SCF level for the negative ion.
For H, Li and Be (where exponents were not given by Dunning and Hay)
the exponents were obtained by simply extending the exponents to smaller
values, assuming an even-tempered progression.  The Ne exponent, which was
not given by Dunning and Hay, was estimated on the basis of neighboring
elements.
