SOMETHING TO NOTE:

We ran into some issues with initialization lists when implementing
ewxNonBoldLabel.  Init lists are great tools that can sometimes enhance
performance and almost always make a program more "exception safe".

Another quick digression... it was decided to implement ewx classes as
subclasses of their wx counterparts so that we could control the fonts,
colors, etc and set them to our own Ecce defaults (every developer's GUIs
will look the same style-wise.)  This methodology worked well up until
ewxNonBoldLabel because before ewxNonBoldLabel, every wx base class had only
ONE derived ewx class.

ewxStyledWindow uses the C++ RTTI system to determine which wx base class was
being styled and there was no need to know which ewx derived class it was.  
When I attempted to dynamically cast to the ewx derived class instead,
nothing happened and instead the wx base class was typed and used.  Why?

Answer: the derived class ewxStaticText called setStyle with a "this"
pointer from within the initialization list.  Because it was in an init list,
the instance of ewxNonBoldLabel was not yet in existance, so the pointer 
was not of the desired type.

When a constructor is called for a derived class, it calls the default, no
argument constructors of its base classes in a depth-first left-to-right
order based on the class declarations.  In our case the order was:
wxStaticText, ewxStyledWindow, ewxStaticText, then ewxNonBoldLabel.
At the moment ewxStaticText called setStyles with the "this" pointer, "this"
was only a wxStaticText/ewxStyledWindow and nothing more derived.

Solutions (best and proper):
The best solution is to eliminate the StyledWindow constructor that calls
setStyles, change all of the dynamic casts in the setStyles method to cast to
their ewx classes and not their wx base classes, and move the StyledWindow
constructor call out of the init list and call setStyles from within the 
constructor bodies for all derived ewx classes.
