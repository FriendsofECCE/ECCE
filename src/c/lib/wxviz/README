This file stores the initial index for the widget IDs automatically generated
from dialog blocks. The purpose of this file is to keep track of all the
GUI classes to guarantee that none of the classes have duplicated IDs. Each
new class should increment the starting ID of the previously highest class
ID by 100 (we assume that this will be enough but if the previous class is
composed of an inordinately large number of widgets, you may need to increment
by a higher number). Please keep this list up to date as you add new GUI
classes to this library. Reserve 2000 for each directory. The starting increment
for this class of widgets is 200000
