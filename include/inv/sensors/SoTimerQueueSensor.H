 |   Description:
 |	Abstract base class for all sensors that are added to the timer
 |	queue. Each sensor in the timer queue contains an SbTime
 |	indicating when the sensor should be triggered. Sensors in the
 |	timer queue are sorted by their trigger times.
 |	Each subclass defines public methods for specifying when and how
 |	to trigger the sensor.
