 |   Description:
 |	Abstract base class for all sensors that are added to the delay
 |	queue, which means that they will be executed at some time in the
 |	future (when there is idle time, or when a user-defined timeout
 |	occurs-- see SoDB::setDelaySensorTimeout()).
 |
 |	Sensors in the delay queue are sorted by priorities. A priority of
 |	0 indicates that the sensor is immediate and should be triggered
 |	immediately when it is scheduled. Sensors with other priorities
 |	are sorted by increasing priority.
