 |   Description:
 |	Timer sensors trigger repeatedly at regular
 |	intervals, starting at a given base time. By default, the base
 |	time is the current time (at the time the sensor is scheduled or
 |	rescheduled) and the interval is 1/30 of a second; both of these
 |	values may be changed.  If more than one interval passes while
 |	sensors are being triggered, then the extra intervals will be lost
 |	(timers always reschedule themselves to occur in the future).
 |	If more than one timer has expired (and therefore more than one
 |	needs to be rescheduled), all of them are first triggered, and are
 |	then rescheduled relative to the current time.  The reschedule()
 |	method is called by the sensor manager to accomplish this (see the
 |	comments there about saturating the timer queue).
