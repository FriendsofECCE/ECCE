 |   Description:
 |	This file defines the SbSphereSheetProjector class. This is a
 |	sphere with a hyperbolic sheet draped over it. As the
 |	mouse moves away from the sphere, rotation gradually
 |	turns into pure roll.
 |
 |	This projector is good for trackballs that want to do
 |	constinuous roll. It allows pure roll as you move away
 |	from the sphere. (This projector uses the same paradigm 
 |	as the "Flip" demo.)
 |
 |	Warning: This projector tends to become unstable when
 |	the mouse position is beyond about 2*radius from the
 |	center of the sphere. Therefore, it is best to use this
 |	as a large, window-sized trackball.
