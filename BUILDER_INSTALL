ECCE Builder Installation
=========================


Overview
--------

The ECCE Builder can be installed and run on most Linux 32- and 64-bit 
operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, 
OpenSUSE, and Mint.  This includes both native and virtual machine 
Linux installs using VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org) or VMware 
(http://www.vmware.com).  Installing Linux as a virtual machine allows 
sites with only Windows or Macintosh OS X workstations to run the 
ECCE Builder.  A minimum of 2 GB of memory is needed to run both 
your Linux operating system and the ECCE Builder although 4 GB or 
more is recommended.  The minimum free disk space needed to install 
the ECCE Builder is 250 MB.

The ECCE Builder uses the wxWidgets GUI toolkit, which is built on the 
Gtk toolkit with the base X Window System and OpenGL for 
visualization.  Linux workstations running the ECCE Builder must have 
either 32-bit i686 processors or 64-bit x86_64 processors constrained by 
the memory and disk space requirements mentioned above.  The ECCE 
Builder software can be installed on each individual workstation on 
which it will be run, or preferably in a multi-user environment, on a 
shared file system such as NFS or AFS that each workstation accesses.

Download ECCE Builder Binary Distribution or Build Source Distribution

Instructions for obtaining the ECCE Builder can be found on the ECCE 
website at http://ecce.pnl.gov.  The download website has both 32- and 
64-bit binary distributions and a source code distribution.  Binary 
distributions are provided for both the ECCE Builder application and the 
full ECCE software suite.  Although the ECCE Builder binary 
distribution is built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the operating system 
supported for the EMSL where ECCE is developed), this distribution 
should run on a variety of Linux operating systems.  This is possible by 
bundling all the shared libraries required for the ECCE Builder including 
system libraries that are normally present on most Linux systems, but 
may not be fully compatible with what was used to create the ECCE 
Builder binary distribution on Red Hat.  The ECCE Builder binary 
distribution has been tested with operating systems including Debian, 
Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, and Mint in addition to Red Hat.

Sites having difficulty using the ECCE Builder binary distributions those 
considering modifying or adding to ECCE code, or those just wanting a 
better understanding of the ECCE software can download and build 
ECCE from the source code distribution.  The results from completing an 
ECCE source code build as documented in the build/README file in 
that distribution (the build directory is not included with the ECCE 
Builder binary distribution) will be an ECCE Builder binary distribution 
specific to the Linux operating system and hard platform on which it was 
built.  This new ECCE Builder binary distribution is identical in structure 
to those downloadable from the ECCE website and thus the install 
documentation herein should be followed to complete the installation.

Using a web browser, download the desired ECCE distribution for your 
platform to a local disk directory.  File size for downloading is displayed 
on the web page although having sufficient additional free disk space 
during installation is critical since ECCE distributions are compressed 
and extraction will multiply the size requirements.  This document 
assumes that either an ECCE Builder binary distribution is downloaded 
or that a source code distribution has been downloaded, built, and a new 
ECCE Builder binary distribution has been generated from that build as 
the starting point for the installation procedures given below.  Full ECCE 
binary distribution installations are documented separately.


Install ECCE Builder
--------------------

The installation procedures assume a basic familiarity with UNIX/Linux 
system administration.  Commands given are for sh and also apply to 
bash; if you are using another shell such as csh or tcsh, you may need to 
adjust the syntax.

In order to maintain the integrity of the installation, we recommend 
creating an account named ecceadm, for "ECCE Administrator", or 
something similar and installing as that user.  There are many 
configuration files, along with the Builder executable and libraries that if 
removed or improperly modified will corrupt the installation.
 
The ECCE Builder distribution itself is a self-extracting C shell 
installation script along with bzip2 format compressed tar files 
containing the Builder application software.  The installation script 
prompts for configuration settings and then performs the installation.

Run the install_ecce_builder.*.csh script in the directory where it was 
downloaded.  You may need to add execute permission to the file first.  
Note that values in square brackets are defaults and you may simply hit 
return to use a default.  For clarity, values are always explicitly entered 
for the prompts in this sample install even when the default value is used.  
Here is the sample invocation of install_ecce_builder.*.csh, run as 
ecceadm with links to notes describing how to determine appropriate 
values for each of the configuration settings:

        prompt$ cd /myfiles
        prompt$ chmod +x ./ install_ecce_builder.v6.4.rhel5-gcc4.1.2-m64.csh
        prompt$ ./ install_ecce_builder.v6.4.rhel5-gcc4.1.2-m64.csh

        Extracting ECCE Builder distribution from 
        ./install_ecce_builder.v6.4.rhel5-gcc4.1.2-m64.csh...

        ECCE Builder installation directory: [/myfiles/ecce-builder-v6.4] 
        /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4

        ECCE Builder v6.4 installation directory: [/sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4]
 
        Is this choice correct (yes/no/quit)? [yes] yes

        Installing ECCE Builder in /sharednfs /ecce-builder-v6.4...
          Extracting ECCE Builder distribution...
          Extracting client WebHelp distribution...
          Configuring ECCE Builder...

        ECCE Builder installation succeeded.

        *******************************************************
        !! You MUST perform the following step to use the ECCE Builder!!

        -- Before running the ECCE Builder each user must source a
           setup script.  For csh/tcsh users, add this to ~/.cshrc:
             if ( -e /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts/runtime_setup ) then
                source /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts/runtime_setup
             endif
           For sh/bash users, add this to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc:
             if [ -e /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts/runtime_setup.sh ]; then
                .  /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts/runtime_setup.sh
             fi
        *******************************************************

        prompt$

After the install_ecce_builder.*.csh script has completed, you may delete 
the distribution script although we recommend waiting until the Builder 
is completely tested at your site.

The next several paragraphs describe how to choose appropriate values 
for the ECCE Builder installation prompts as shown above.  If you have 
successfully run the installation script and understand the prompts, you 
may skip to Post-Install Configuration to continue with the installation.

ECCE Builder installation directory:  The ECCE Builder is designed 
for installation under a single shared directory at a site, with all hosts 
accessing the common installation.  A local file system disk is selected 
for the installation directory when the Builder will only be run from a 
single machine.  If you have a shared file system and will have multiple 
machines and/or platforms running the Builder, we recommend installing 
under the shared file system as it reduces parallel administration.  The 
shared directory where the Builder is installed is independent of the 
directory where the distribution script is run, although the default will be 
a subdirectory of the run directory.  For access from multiple machines 
the distribution is typically downloaded to local disk to speed file 
transfer, and then installed to a shared file system.  This file system 
should have at least 200 megabytes free for each platform that will be 
installed.  To install multiple platforms to a shared file system, specify 
the same Builder installation directory for each platform (requires 
downloading and running the installation script distribution for each 
platform).  The installation script automatically extracts platform-
dependent libraries and executables into separate subdirectories.  The 
absolute path to the directory where the ECCE Builder is installed is 
stored in the ECCE runtime setup and runtime_setup.sh scripts as the 
environment variable $ECCE_HOME.  The rest of this document uses 
the term "ECCE Builder installation directory" and slight variations 
interchangeably with $ECCE_HOME, especially when referring to file 
paths.

You are not allowed to overwrite an existing ECCE Builder installation 
except in the case where you are installing different platforms under the 
same top-level directory.  The installation script will verify that the 
directory specified is not a previous installation for the same platform 
and prompt for a new directory if it is.  This restriction prevents the 
inadvertent loss of a working installation should the new one have some 
kind of problem.  If you do wish to install a new version of the ECCE 
Builder in the same top level directory as an existing installation for the 
same platform, you must move the old installation to another directory 
prior to running the install_ecce_builder.*.csh script.  We recommend 
that you only remove an existing installation after you have verified the 
operation of the new installation.

Is this choice correct:  Pressing return or entering "yes" results in the 
ECCE Builder installation completing under the specified installation 
directory.  Entering "no" results in the installation directory being 
prompted for again.


Post-install Configuration
--------------------------

* Change the Default Web Browser

The ECCE Builder uses a web browser for online help and the user 
support request web page.  At this time Firefox and Mozilla are 
compatible with how the ECCE Builder controls the display of web 
pages externally (KDE Konqueror, for instance, does not allow the 
control needed).  By default Firefox is configured as the web browser 
within the ECCE Builder.  This can be changed by editing the 
$ECCE_HOME/siteconfig/site_runtime file and scrolling down to the 
entries for web browsers.  The only valid values for the browsers are 
"firefox" and "mozilla".

Setup Users' Environment

* For sh and bash users, add the following lines to their ~/.profile or 
~/.bashrc file, substituting the correct path under which the ECCE 
Builder was installed on your host: 

	# setup to run ECCE Builder
	if [ -e /sharednfs/ecce-builder/scripts/runtime_setup.sh ]; then
	  .  /sharednfs/ecce-builder/scripts/runtime_setup.sh
	fi

* There is an equivalent script named runtime_setup in the same 
directory that can be sourced for csh and tcsh users in their ~/.cshrc 
(~/.mycshrc within EMSL) file, substituting the correct path under 
which the ECCE Builder was installed on your host:

	# setup to run ECCE Builder
	if ( -e /sharednfs/ecce-builder/scripts/runtime_setup) then
	  source /sharednfs/ecce-builder/scripts/runtime_setup
	endif

Hint:  Within EMSL, we maintain a symbolic link named scripts in a 
top-level shared ECCE Builder directory that contains multiple 
releases of the Builder.  The scripts link points to the scripts 
directory for the current production version of the ECCE Builder.  
This way the ECCE administrator only needs to update this link to 
change the version all ECCE Builder users are running.  Users 
wishing to run other than the default version the symbolic link points 
to can change their environment setup file to reference the 
runtime_setup or runtime_setup.sh script for the desired version.  
The path to runtime_setup and runtime_setup.sh under 
/sharednfs/ecce-builder/scripts in the example above is based upon 
this mechanism.  In the example installation, ECCE was installed 
under /sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4.  A symbolic link in the 
/sharednfs/ecce-builder directory named scripts pointing to 
/sharednfs/ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts will make it easier for the ECCE 
administrator to upgrade users to new versions of the ECCE Builder.  
The commands to do this for the example installation are:

	prompt$ mkdir /sharednfs/ecce-builder
	prompt$ cd /sharednfs/ecce-builder
	prompt$ ln -s ../ecce-builder-v6.4/scripts  scripts

* Logout then log back in again to make sure the environment is 
properly setup.  Enter the command "which ebuilder" to make sure 
paths are correct.

Run ECCE Builder

* Start the ECCE Builder by typing...

prompt$ ebuilder

* Where to go for help

Check out the ECCE Builder help pages on the web at 
http://ecce.emsl.pnl.gov/cgi-bin/help/toolhelp?builder, which are also 
accessible from within the ECCE Builder under the menubar Help 
menu.  Also visit the user FAQ and Release Notes for the current and 
previous releases of ECCE, including the Builder application.  The 
release notes serve as the most up-to-date and complete 
documentation of ECCE Builder features.
